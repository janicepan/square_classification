# Square Classification Case Study

This repo contains:

- image_classifier_trainer.py: script to train model
- image_classifier_evaluator.py: script to report results and plot errors
- best_model_128x128.h5: trained model

To run the scripts, make sure the squares dataset is also located within this folder.
The dataset folder should be called "squares", and it should have "train" and "val" folders
containing the images organized per class in folders called "a", "b", and "c".
